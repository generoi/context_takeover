Context Takeover
========

Context reaction to display a takeover banner using colorbox.

Installation
------------
1. Enable
2. Configure your context using the reaction "Takeover overlay"
3. If you include images, you should force their size using a style property
   (possibly an important depending on your themes styling). Otherwise colorbox
   might collapse the banner because it cant calculate its layout size.
   (<img src="" width="600" height="400" style="width: 600px !important;
   height: 400px !important;")
